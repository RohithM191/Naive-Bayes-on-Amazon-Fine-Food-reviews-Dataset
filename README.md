# Amazon-Food-Reviews-Analysis using KNN

### Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Text Featurization(BOW,TFIDF,AVG-Word2Vec,TFIDF-W2V).                                                                                                        

Naive Bayes
1. Applied Naive Bayes using Bernoulli NB and Multinomial NB on different Data Featurization & visualization . BOW(uni-gram),TFIDF,AVG-W2V,TFIDF-W2V. 
2. Evaluated the test data on various performance metrics like accuracy, f1-score, precision, recall,etc. and also plotted Confusion matrix using seaborne.
3. Printed Top 20 Important Features for both Negative and Positive Reviews

###### Conclusions:
1. Naive Bayes is much faster algorithm than KNN
2. The performance of bernoulli naive bayes is way much more better than multinomial naive bayes.
